#+TITLE: AI Typescript TicTacToe

Train a neural network to play TicTacToe

* Training

From an interactive ts-node session:

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
import * as NN from "./src/player/neuralNetwork";
import { execute, training } from "./src/player/neuralNetwork/training";

execute(training(NN.mkModel({ boardDimension: 3 }), { numGames: 100 }))

// > [SUCCESS] Execution success: {
//   total: { runs: 100, xs: 83, os: 13, ties: 4 },
//   totalRatio: { xs: 0.83, os: 0.13, ties: 0.04 }
// }
#+END_SRC
